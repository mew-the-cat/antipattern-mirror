# Elevator Pitch

Imagine finding your perfect financial partner, tailored to your needs, goals, and even hobbies â€“ all with just a few clicks. Welcome to FinTwin. Instead of thrusting you into the vast world of banking, our app guides you directly to advisors who match you not just professionally, but personally. And the best part? You're in control. By actively choosing, you value the relationship with your advisor more and achieve better outcomes. With FinTwin, we're making finance personal and effective. Support an innovation in banking that's revolutionizing the customer experience.

# Why do you need FinTwin

Autonomy & Control: Customers can proactively choose an advisor that aligns with their individual needs, instead of just being assigned someone.

The "IKEA" Effect: People value things they have had a hand in creating or selecting more. Through active matching, the customer feels more involved in the process and is likely more satisfied with the outcome.

Time Efficiency: Instead of having multiple bank appointments and realizing the advisor isn't the right fit, customers can find the right match from the get-go with this app.

Less Intimidation: Finances can be daunting. An advisor that matches a customer's communication style and needs can break down this barrier.

Holistic Approach: It's not just about finding the right expert, but someone who also fits on a personal level. A good match can lead to a long-term, trustful relationship.

Overcoming Ignorance: Not every customer knows exactly which service they need or who to turn to. The app guides them through this process and provides recommendations based on their input.

By combining these criteria and advantages, FinTwin can be an effective and appealing tool for both customers and financial advisors alike.

# Monetization Workflow for FinTwin

1. Initiation: The user initiates the matchmaking process and browses profiles of bank advisors.
2. Base Level: Every bank advisor starts at this level. Matching with advisors at this level is free for all app users.
3. Dynamic Pricing: Depending on the number of successful matches an advisor has, their "value" within the app increases.
4. Tiered Progression:
Silver: After, for instance, 10 successful matches. Matching with Silver advisors might require a small fee or a basic subscription.
Gold: After, for instance, 50 successful matches. This could necessitate a premium subscription to the app.
Platinum: After, for instance, 100 successful matches. Matching with Platinum advisors might incur an additional charge, but premium subscribers receive a discount on the consultation fees.
5. Subscription Options:
Basic Subscription: Allows matching with Silver advisors and includes a limited number of matches per month. 
Premium Subscription: Enables matching with Gold advisors and offers discounts on Platinum consultations. It also provides unlimited matches per month.
6. Additional Fees for Platinum Consultations: While the matching itself is covered by the subscription, there might be extra charges for actual consultations with a Platinum advisor.
7. Feedback & Adjustment: User feedback can constantly refine the pricing and tier system to remain appealing for both users and advisors.
8. Promotions and Discounts: To enhance user loyalty and encourage subscription upgrades, regular discounts or promotions can be offered for various subscription tiers.

With this tiered system, advisors are incentivized to offer high-quality consultations to achieve more matches and, thus, higher tiers. Simultaneously, users gain value by accessing more experienced advisors, controlling their costs based on their chosen subscription.
